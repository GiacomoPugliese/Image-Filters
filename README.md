Developed an image filtering software as a part of the Harvard CS50 cirriculum, using C to implement filters such as grayscale, edge detection, reflect, and blur for image manipulation. Applied advanced algorithms like the Sobel operator for precise edge detection, and optimized the program's execution through effective memory management and minimizing resource usage.
